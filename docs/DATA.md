## Wind Averaging Duration Conversions

### Why is conversion necessary?

Wind speeds depend heavily on the averaging duration. One cannot directly compare 1-hour values with 10-minute or 2-minute measurements. All sources must be harmonized to a common temporal base before any comparison.

### Typical Conversion Factors

## 1. Meteostat – Observed Data from Weather Stations

**API Link**: [https://dev.meteostat.net/](https://dev.meteostat.net/)

### Source Profile: Meteostat

#### Data Type
- **Observed**, sourced from official weather stations (SYNOP, METAR, national networks).
- Data collected from sources such as NOAA ISD, DWD (Germany), Environment Canada, etc.
- Aggregation and harmonization managed by the Meteostat team.

Raw Meteostat data is retrieved in km/h (API native unit), and then converted to m/s (1 m/s = 3.6 km/h) upon import into Wind Data to ensure consistency with other sources.

#### Measurement Height
- **Typically: 10 meters above ground**, in line with WMO recommendations.
- **⚠️ However**, there is **no guarantee** of uniform sensor height; individual stations may vary.
- Meteostat does **not provide** exact instrument height via API but follows the WMO standard when the source specifies it.

#### Averaging Period
- **Mean wind (`windspeed_mean`)**: 10-minute moving average, in line with **WMO No. 8**.
  - This period applies mainly to SYNOP and METAR stations, which dominate the Meteostat database.

#### Gusts (`gust`)
- Represent the **maximum 3-second wind speed** observed during the previous period (often 10 min).
- If available, Meteostat includes this 3-second gust value per WMO standards.

#### Wind Direction
- Wind **origin direction**, expressed in azimuth degrees:
  - `0°` = from North, `90°` = from East, `180°` = from South, `270°` = from West
- Measured over the same 10-minute period as the mean speed.

#### Typical Variables (when available)

| Variable         | Description                         | Unit  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| `windspeed_mean` | 10-minute average wind speed        | km/h  |
| `wind_direction` | 10-minute average wind direction    | deg   |
| `gust`           | Max 3-second gust during interval   | km/h  |

## 2. NOAA ISD – Raw Hourly Observational Data

**Data link**: [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/)

### Source Profile: NOAA ISD (Integrated Surface Dataset)

#### Data Type
- **Observed**, collected from official weather stations worldwide.
- Primary source: **ISD**, maintained by NOAA (NCEI).
- Derived from METAR, SYNOP, and AUTO messages, aggregated from over **35,000 stations**.

#### Measurement Height
- The **instrument height** varies by station.
- NOAA’s recommended anemometer height is **10 meters**, but it is **not always explicitly listed** in CSV files from the public portal.
- To estimate the measurement context → refer to `isd-history.csv` (field `ELEV` ≠ anemometer height but useful for terrain).

#### Frequency and Averaging Period
- **Typical frequency**: hourly (sometimes sub-hourly).
- **Wind speed (`WND`)**:  
  - Represents a **10-minute average** prior to the observation time.  
  - Source: [NOAA ISH Format Documentation (PDF)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/ish-format-document.pdf), section WND.
- **Wind direction**: average over the same 10-minute period.

#### Gusts (`GUST`)
- When present, **GUST** represents the **maximum 5-second gust** within the hour preceding observation.
- ⚠️ Not all stations report this variable (often missing in older or regional files).

#### Wind Direction
- Expressed in **azimuth degrees**, WMO standard:
  - `0°` = from North, `90°` = from East, etc.
- Invalid values are encoded as `999`.

#### Example of NOAA ISD CSV format

| Field     | Description                          | Example              |

| `GUST`    | Max 5-second gust (if available)     | `25.1`               |
| `DRCT`    | Wind direction (alternative field)   | `270`                |

#### Typical Variables Extracted for Wind Data

| Variable         | Description                           | Unit  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|--------|

## 3. Open-Meteo – Modeled Data via API

**API Link**: [https://open-meteo.com/](https://open-meteo.com/)

### Source Profile: Open-Meteo

#### Data Type
- **Modeled data**, derived from open-source numerical weather models.
- Provided by the **Open-Meteo API**, which aggregates several public datasets.
- These are **not observations**, but **interpolated forecasts or reanalyses**.

Raw Open-Meteo data is retrieved in km/h and converted to m/s (1 m/s = 3.6 km/h) within Wind Data for consistency.

#### Models Used
Depending on the variable, hour, and location, Open-Meteo uses:
- **ICON** (DWD – Germany)
- **ECMWF HRES**
- **GFS** (NOAA global model)

For historical weather, Open-Meteo uses archived forecasts or reanalyses (exact details not always disclosed).

#### Measurement Height
- All wind variables are standardized at **10 meters above ground**, per WMO guidelines.
- ⚠️ These are **modeled values at 10 m**, not direct sensor measurements.

#### Temporal Frequency and Averaging
- Data frequency: **hourly**
- `windspeed_10m`: hourly modeled mean wind
- `windgusts_10m`: hourly modeled maximum gust

#### Gusts (`windgusts_10m`)
- Represents **modeled maximum wind gust** over the hour.
- May **underestimate peaks** due to model smoothing and horizontal resolution (~10–20 km).

#### Wind Direction
- `winddirection_10m`: wind origin direction in **azimuth degrees** (`0°` = North, `90°` = East, etc.)
- Represents hourly average from the model.

#### Typical Variables

| Variable            | Description                            | Unit  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| `windspeed_10m`     | Hourly mean modeled wind at 10 m       | km/h   |
| `windgusts_10m`     | Hourly max modeled gust at 10 m        | km/h   |
| `winddirection_10m` | Hourly modeled average direction       | degrees|

#### Technical Summary

| Element             | Detail                                                         |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source              | Open-Meteo API                                                 |
| Type                | Numerical model / reanalysis                                   |
| Height              | 10 m (standardized)                                            |
| Mean wind           | Hourly modeled mean (`windspeed_10m`)                          |
| Gusts               | Hourly modeled max gust (`windgusts_10m`)                      |
| Direction           | Hourly modeled azimuthal origin (`winddirection_10m`)          |
| Temporal frequency  | Hourly                                                        |
| Standard followed   | WMO height conventions (model → not equivalent to measurements)|

#### ⚠️ Why Open-Meteo May Underestimate Wind Speeds

Even though Open-Meteo delivers reasonably accurate average wind data, it can **underestimate peak values** compared to real station measurements, due to:

- **Model parametrization**: Grid-scale simulations (~10 km) smooth localized accelerations.
- **Generalized surface roughness**: Land-use variations (urban, forest, coastlines) are averaged across grid cells.
- **Energy conservation tuning**: Numerical stability sometimes dampens peaks.
- **No microclimate detection**: Models do not "see" specific effects like valleys, passes, or coastal gaps.
- **Temporal smoothing**: Hourly values are averaged over time steps (~1h), hiding sub-hourly variability.

## 4. ERA5 – Reanalysis Data from ECMWF

**Copernicus CDS Link**: [ERA5 Single Levels Dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels)

### Source Profile: ERA5 (Copernicus / ECMWF)

#### Data Type
- **Modeled climate reanalysis**, produced by the **European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)**.
- Distributed via the **Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)**.
- Combines a global numerical weather model (IFS) with assimilation of millions of observations (stations, satellites, radiosondes...).

#### Measurement Height
- Winds are provided at **10 meters above ground**:
  - `10m_u_component_of_wind`
  - `10m_v_component_of_wind`
- These components are interpolated from model levels over grid cell surfaces.

#### Temporal Frequency and Averaging
- **Hourly data**, with a **1-hour resolution**.
- Wind speeds are derived as:  
  `windspeed = sqrt(u² + v²)`
- These values represent a **spatial average over a 31 km grid cell**.

Wind Data uses ERA5 Single Levels Timeseries via CDSAPI because it delivers clean CSV files ready for automated processing.

**Advantages:**
- Fast and easy download
- No need for GRIB/NetCDF parsing
- Fully compatible with Wind Data automation

**Known Limitation:**  
This product **does not provide wind gusts** (`10m_wind_gust_since_previous_post_processing` is not available here).

Gusts are only available in:
- ERA5 hourly on single levels (GRIB/NetCDF)
- ERA5-Land hourly (GRIB/NetCDF)

**Strategic Choice:**  
Wind Data prioritizes CSV-based automation and consistency, even if that means omitting ERA5 gusts for now.  
This trade-off is documented and assumed for full transparency.

#### Wind Direction
- Computed from U/V components:  
  `direction = arctan2(-u, -v)`
- Wind **origin direction**, expressed in azimuth degrees (`0°` = North, `90°` = East...).

#### Typical Variables

| Variable                      | Description                         | Unit |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------|
| `10m_u_component_of_wind`     | Zonal (west-east) wind component    | m/s  |
| `10m_v_component_of_wind`     | Meridional (south-north) component  | m/s  |

#### Technical Summary

| Height              | 10 m above ground                                   |
| Mean wind           | Hourly grid-based mean                              |
| Gusts               | Not available in CSV version                        |
| Direction           | From U/V components (azimuth origin)                |

#### ⚠️ Limitations and Notes (ECMWF)

> “Yes, the underestimation is related to the limited spatial resolution of ERA5, and the fact that ERA5 represents an area average.”  
> — *Hans Hersbach, ECMWF*

- **ERA5 tends to smooth extreme winds**, especially local gusts.
- **Stations give point measurements**, while ERA5 provides **area means over 31 km²**.
- **Empirical correction** is possible and encouraged when comparing with observed data.
- **ERA6** is under development with higher resolution (expected ~late 2026).

## Weather Station Metadata – Technical Profile

### Why Metadata Is Essential

Wind measurements (observed or modeled) depend on:
- **Measurement height**
- **Terrain and surrounding environment**
- **Instrument quality and exposure**

⇒ Without metadata, any source comparison is biased or incomplete.

| Issue                             | Explanation                                                            |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unknown anemometer height        | Default assumption: 10 m (WMO), but actual height may vary (6–15 m)    |
| Sheltered station                | Nearby obstacles (trees, buildings, terrain) reduce wind measurement   |
| No documented environment        | Terrain, roughness, exposure not always described                      |
| Missing/incomplete variables     | `GUST` or `DRCT` fields often absent in older files                    |
| Imprecise location               | Lat/lon rounded to 2 decimals → large uncertainty on real position     |
| Unknown station type             | May impact calibration, maintenance and data quality                   |

### How to Assess Roughness & Terrain Context

#### 1. Visual Inspection (Google Earth, Street View)
- Identify forests, buildings, terrain orientation
- Match land cover to Eurocode **z0 roughness classes**:

| Terrain Type             | Typical `z0` Roughness | Example                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Sea / lake               | 0.0002 – 0.003          | ocean, large open water                |
| Open flat terrain        | 0.01 – 0.03             | fields, plains, deserts                |
| Semi-open countryside    | 0.05 – 0.1              | farmland, isolated villages            |
| Suburban / low urban     | 0.2 – 0.5               | subdivisions, small towns              |
| Dense urban core         | 1.0 – 2.0               | large cities, skyscrapers              |
| Forest / mountainous     | > 0.5                   | hills, forests, ridges                 |

#### 2. Satellite and Open Data
- Use CORINE Land Cover, Copernicus, SRTM rasters to estimate land use
- Automatic roughness classification may be possible in the future via GIS/API

#### 3. Qualitative Score in Wind Data
- Wind Data allows assigning an **exposure score from 1 to 5**:
  - 5 = very exposed (plateau, coast)
  - 1 = very sheltered (valley, forest, city center)

### Integration in Wind Data

For each station (Meteostat, NOAA, etc.), Wind Data stores:
- **Measurement height** (default: 10 m if unknown)
- **Distance to the site** (in km)
- **Estimated terrain type / roughness**
- **Available variables** (to determine comparison feasibility)
- **Exposure score (1–5)** and optional comment field

---

### Final Goal

> Provide for each station a **clear technical fact sheet**, including:
> - Measurement and environmental metadata
> - Missing or uncertain data fields
> - Roughness and exposure estimates
> - Station reliability for wind analysis
