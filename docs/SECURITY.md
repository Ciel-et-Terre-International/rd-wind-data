# Security Policy – WindDatas

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project is not currently deployed publicly in production. Therefore, no critical security policy is in place at this stage.

However, if you discover a vulnerability:

- Please open a **private issue** or contact me directly at:  
  [adrien.salicis@cieletterre.net](mailto:adrien.salicis@cieletterre.net)
- I commit to responding within a reasonable time frame.
- If the project is adopted by a wider team, a full security policy will be established.

---

## Affected Versions

Currently, only the `main` branch (version `v1.0.0`) is considered maintained.

---

## Future Considerations

If WindDatas becomes open-source and used in production contexts, the following will be defined:

- A formal vulnerability disclosure procedure
- Clear roles and timelines for response and remediation
- Version-specific security advisories if needed
